|   3.2   | Make sure you implement the 3 methods:                         |         |        |
|         | `Node* Add(string val1, string val2)`                          |         |        |
|         | `Node* Sub(string val1, string val2)`                          |         |        |
|         | `Node* Mul(string val1, string val2)`                          |         |        |
|   3.3   | Each method returns a doubly linked list.                      |         |        |
|   3.3   | Print method exists and writes answer to file.                 |         |        |
