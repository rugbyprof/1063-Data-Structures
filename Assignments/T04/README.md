## Final - Study Materials

- Look at all the study guides and tests from the previous 3 exams.
- At the minimum you should be able to:
  - Write **Functions**!! (This is the basis for nearly ALL solutions).
  - Implement and use dynamic arrays.
  - Use array of complex data structures (like arrays of structs).
  - Write sytactically correct **classes**.
  - **Linked Lists**
    - Create a linked list class
    - Be able to traverse a singly linked list and manipulate the values in each node
    - Delete a node from a list
    - Add a node to a list
  - Understand **stack** and **queue** operations.
  - Understand the difference between **array based** and **list based** structures
    - Write an array based stack class
    - Write an array based queue class
    - Write a list based stack class
    - Write a list based queue class
  - **Recursion**
    - Understand components of recursion
    - Be able to traverse a list recursively 
    - Write recursive functions:
      - Some examples:
        - SumDigits (add each digit together and return the sum)
        - PrintReverse (e.g. 12345 would print 54321)
        - CountEvenDigits - counts the even digits in a number (e.g. 12345678 would return 4)
  - Binary search
  - Put items into a binary tree in its proper location
