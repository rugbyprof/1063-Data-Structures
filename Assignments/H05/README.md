## Homework 5 - Fix the loop
#### Due: November 7<sup>th</sup> by classtime.

### Requirements

Using the code in [main.cpp](./main.cpp) find the error in the loop and fix it so it terminates and creates the new list with all of the nodes from the old list in order.

### Deliverables

Print out the [main.cpp](./main.cpp) with a comment code block at the top (look at program 3 for an example code block).
